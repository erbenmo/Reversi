1) Find All possible place to put pieces
	Branching factor may not be that high
	
	How to find those candidates?
		???
		
3) Make a random one...

2) Simple Bot: Make a greedy one
	How many if can flip in next run
	2+) Static H Bot: 
		With different weight
	2++) Dynamic H Bot
		Dynamic weight, how?
		simple look ahead..



4) Mini-Max!
	Assume opponent also uses Min-Max
	utility = strength-a / strength-b
		a max utility, b min utility
	board[][] info?
	
	

~) loop until get right human input	
~) game over
~) test greedy & static

5) min-max & alpha-beta!
	~)	merge 6 move_* functions
	~)	bug in the end!?
	~)	too dummy!
	

4) figure out dynamic
